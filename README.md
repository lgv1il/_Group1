Education plays a vital role in shaping the future of individuals and societies. However, various factors influence student performance, such as age, parental education, extracurricular activities, and personal habits. Understanding these factors can help educators and policymakers enhance the learning experience and improve outcomes. 
In our project, we aim to analyze student performance data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to their academic success or struggles.
